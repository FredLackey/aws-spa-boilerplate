### Notes

- All shell scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`) and include proper shebang lines
- JSON data files are generated during deployment and should be human-readable with proper indentation
- CDK infrastructure code follows TypeScript conventions and AWS CDK best practices
- The main `go-a.sh` script should remain under 200 lines by delegating to helper scripts
