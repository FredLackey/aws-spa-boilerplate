Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]

This script will completely remove all Stage C Lambda resources and revert
to the state before Stage C deployment.

Options:
  -h, --help           Show this help message
  --force              Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution)

Examples:
  $0                   # Interactive rollback with confirmation
  $0 --force           # Automatic rollback without confirmation

Warning:
  This action cannot be undone. All Lambda function data, logs, and
  configurations will be permanently deleted.
