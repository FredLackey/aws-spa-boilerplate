# Task List: Stage A CloudFront Deployment

## Relevant Files

- `stages/a-cloudfront/go-a.sh` - Main orchestration script that coordinates the entire deployment workflow
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/gather-inputs.sh` - Interactive script for collecting user inputs (AWS profiles, distribution prefix, region)
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/aws-discovery.sh` - Script for AWS account discovery and resource validation
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh` - CDK deployment orchestration and error handling
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/deploy-content.sh` - Application file upload and CloudFront cache management
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/validate-deployment.sh` - HTTP testing and deployment validation procedures
- `stages/a-cloudfront/scripts/cleanup-rollback.sh` - Error handling and rollback procedures
- `stages/a-cloudfront/iac/app.ts` - CDK application entry point
- `stages/a-cloudfront/iac/lib/cloudfront-stack.ts` - CDK stack defining CloudFront distribution and S3 bucket
- `stages/a-cloudfront/iac/package.json` - CDK project dependencies and scripts
- `stages/a-cloudfront/iac/cdk.json` - CDK configuration file
- `stages/a-cloudfront/data/inputs.json` - User-provided configuration data (generated by scripts)
- `stages/a-cloudfront/data/discovery.json` - AWS account discovery results (generated by scripts)
- `stages/a-cloudfront/data/outputs.json` - Stage deployment outputs for subsequent stages (generated by scripts)

### Notes

- All shell scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`) and include proper shebang lines
- JSON data files are generated during deployment and should be human-readable with proper indentation
- CDK infrastructure code follows TypeScript conventions and AWS CDK best practices
- The main `go-a.sh` script should remain under 200 lines by delegating to helper scripts
