### Notes

- Pattern analysis must be completed before any development work begins
- All scripts and files should follow the naming conventions identified in the pattern analysis
- CDK infrastructure should integrate with existing CloudFront distribution from Stage A AND preserve SSL certificates and domain names from Stage B
- Stage D must not interfere with or modify any SSL certificates, Route53 configuration, or domain name settings established in Stage B
- React build artifacts should be cleaned and rebuilt for each deployment
